# Chess in C++

This is a chess game implemented in C++ as my final project for object-oriented programming. The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for its structure and organization.
## Classes.
In accordance with the MVC pattern, I structured the project as follows:
- ChessControler : This class is responsible for managing the game logic and providing an abstract representation of the game.
- ChessRender :  It handles the display of the chess game for the user.
- ChessContoler This class manages the interaction between the user and the game.
Each class has distinct methods that interact with the Piece class and communicate with one another using the PieceInfo structure.
